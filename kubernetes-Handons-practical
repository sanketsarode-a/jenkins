kubectl get pods -A
kubectl get nodes

kubectl run nginx --image=nginx



cd /etc/kubernetes
ls
admin.conf               kubelet.conf  pki             super-admin.conf
controller-manager.conf  manifests     scheduler.conf

this admin.config is responsible for communicating pods and nodes

cluster se communicate kaise karte hai
cd ~/.kube       
pwd
/root/.kube
ls


content of kube config
cluster
context:-
user


instead of kubectl we can use endpoint 
that interact with each other 
using Rest APIS


ðŸš€Deployment is a kind there can be more such kinds
and when called by curl/Rest API ---> then it is a resource
if core services then --> empty group --> v1


GVK --> Group version kind
if kind :- pod
then core group empty so version is --> v1
if kind :- networking
then core group empty so version is --> v1

GVR --> Group version resource

ðŸš€ create service account --> this is nothing but a user
steps are in github repo 
we are creating using rest api
therefore it is known as resource
