instead of kubectl we can use endpoint 
that interact with each other 
using Rest APIS


ğŸš€Deployment is a kind there can be more such kinds
and when called by curl/Rest API ---> then it is a resource
if core services then --> empty group --> v1


GVK --> Group version kind
if kind :- pod
then core group empty so version is --> v1
if kind :- networking
then core group empty so version is --> v1

GVR --> Group version resource

ğŸš€ create service account --> this is nothing but a user
steps are in github repo 
we are creating using rest api
therefore it is known as resource

ğŸš€Clusters
