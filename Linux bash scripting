start with om here we use shebang
#!/bin/bash
this tells the os which shell to use like we can multiple
sh
zsh
bash

simple if else create a file by name  if it matches 
imp tip there should be proper spacing in between the if and elif conditions


#!/bin/bash
read -p "enter the name" filename
if [[  $filename == sanket ]];
then
    touch $filename.txt
else
echo "wrong name"
fi
