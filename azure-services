Azure ad
Primary use --> authentication and login

before azure ad -->
EK virtual machine hai
3 user hai jo shift mein kam karte hai
har ek username and pasword se login karte hai

or else someone forgots the password then what ??

SO HOW does active directory helps ?
A server --> install active directory
then that server is known as Domain controller

ek boundary --> and user ka laptop uss domain mein register kar denge
aur user ke cred uss Active Directory mein daldiye

ab wohh map rahenge user ke pass uska pass id and same --> map to AD
in this way there can be multiple users 

ad --> pe account bana diya kahi se bhi login karo --> that authenticates it
if forgots his password then we can change it from AD and he can login again

Suppose there is web application and it requires your company user and password
then we can link web application to --> azure active directory
now all user can securely login using the same id pass

very IMP --> id ad fail then no one can login

we will create a Domian controller related to AD
then they can use that domain contoller
basically it can be also used to minimize the latency

replicate AD
then we create a domain controller in that particular region
