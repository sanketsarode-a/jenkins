ðŸš€Azure ad
Primary use --> authentication and login

ðŸš€before azure ad -->
EK virtual machine hai
3 user hai jo shift mein kam karte hai
har ek username and pasword se login karte hai

or else someone forgots the password then what ??

SO HOW does active directory helps ?
A server --> install active directory
then that server is known as Domain controller

ek boundary --> and user ka laptop uss domain mein register kar denge
aur user ke cred uss Active Directory mein daldiye

ab wohh map rahenge user ke pass uska pass id and same --> map to AD
in this way there can be multiple users 

ad --> pe account bana diya kahi se bhi login karo --> that authenticates it
if forgots his password then we can change it from AD and he can login again

Suppose there is web application and it requires your company user and password
then we can link web application to --> azure active directory
now all user can securely login using the same id pass

very IMP --> id ad fail then no one can login

we will create a Domian controller related to AD
then they can use that domain contoller
basically it can be also used to minimize the latency

replicate AD
then we create a domain controller in that particular region

************************
ðŸš€Register an application 
*************************
give a name
select the tenant type
Redirect URL --> ok so if my angular application i can use it for authencation
                 once done go back to my angular
                https://yourapp.com/auth/callback

ðŸš€RBAC
role based access control
just like iam roles and groups

ðŸš€Azure key vaults
Disk can be encrypted with key so that data in the disk remains safe 
in case someone get hands on our disk then he wont be able to get our data

in database username and password -->storing this 
certifacates can be aslo store

ðŸš€Azure functions
serverless compute service
we need to give only code rest backend services manage by azure
everything autumatic 
increase decrease according to traffic

ðŸš€Azure devops rest API
There are lots of thing that can be autumated using rest API

eg- Pipeline
    release
    Approvals
there are post api 
and we want to get build status we will use get API
it is available 
PAT token for authentication
defination id of pipeline --> to autu-trigger

use method invoke for that post API

pipeline run hone ke baad build id nikalo jiske baad mein pipeline ka status check kar sake
uske baad if condition lagayie
if success --> clear cache
if not --> raise a issue

ðŸš€Azure Cache for redis
end user ---> APP ---> usko kisi database se connect kiya 
                  <---
 
Okay database is too large-->then what happens data rettrival takes a long time
so in order to reduce this we use azure redis cache

1 st way --> along with application
2 nd way --> along with database --> instead of seraching data in database searches it in cache
                                     but if data not found then goes in main database
                                     and stores in cache for future use
ðŸš€Azure SQL database
Relational database --> table format (rows and columns)
2 resources are created 1.database
                        2.database server
so we need seprate or one
it has name and password
it must be stored in azure key vault


three Deployment methods
single           -->  isolated
Elastic pool     -->  collection of single
Managed instance -->  costly

purchasing option 
DTU
vcore
serverless

how to connect ?
connection string to be stored in azure vaults
