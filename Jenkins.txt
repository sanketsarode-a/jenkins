Jenkins
{a continuous integration tool}

by default it runs on 8080
but we can customize it on docker 

working directory of jenkins is var/lib/jenkins

what happens in architecture 
-> GitHub is integrated with Jenkins 
-> use Maven to pull the necessary dependencies and compile the code.
-> using selenium automated testing is done 
-> As part of the Jenkins build process, you can configure automated tests to run using Selenium. 


when single jenkins server is not sufficient then 
-> set up an agent
-> master slave is used
-> master instructs to slave and accordingly they work
-> https://chathura-siriwardhana.medium.com/step-by-step-guide-to-add-jenkins-slave-nodes-f2e756c8849e

create a node in jenkins
which act as service agent
if node set up then we can run specific job or stage such as selenium on another machine


the first step in Jenkins is build
-> build means downloading dependencies that are required to build an application
-> and compiling the code before executing

kise dusre tool ke sath kam karna hoga oth uska pligin install karna padegda

How to integrate GitHub
shh 
ssh-keygen
ls -a
cd .ssh
public and private will be seen 
go to github setting add key add public one
go to Jenkins create a job
configure add git url then add credential and 
select branch main
build
done 


Tomcat integration using Jenkins

what is jar and war files in java

source - kernel is updated

java-1.21.0-openjdk-amd64      2111       /usr/lib/jvm/java-1.21.0-openjdk-amd64
ssh build agents
Q regarding aws
private ip rnages 

<tomcat-users>
  <role rolename="tomcat"/>
  <role rolename="role1"/>
  <role rolename="manager-gui"/>
  <role rolename="admin-gui"/>

  <user username="tomcat" password="must-be-changed" roles="tomcat"/>
  <user username="both" password="must-be-changed" roles="tomcat,role1"/>

jenkins role based stratergy

developer has access to deveper job
means we can create user for specific job


Jenkins Q
make a slave node and intergrate tomcat

Scripted Pipelines: Require an agent (node) to be allocated at the beginning.
                    primary based on grovvy syntax and executes all within the 
                    node {} -- block
                    Best for complex logic, custom Groovy scripting, and flexibility.
                    
Declarative Pipelines: Can run without an agent at the top level and allocate agents at specific stages only.
                       more easy and executes all within the 
                       pipeline {}  --block
                       Best for simplicity, readability, and standardized pipelines





know all plugins
1.role based auturization
2.rebuilder plugin
3.slack notification
4.browser stack - take care of cross bowser testing
5.mailer -- to send reports
6.jira -- to raise bugs or ticket
7.docker plugin -- add your cred they will be used in pipeline


for pipeline and GitHub 
ssh
git
pipeline stage view
multibranch pipeline
issue -> version
      -> authentication





*end to end testing
-> when a software is release 
it has individual components such as application server , web server , database
-> so if individual testing is done then there might be complexity ad miscommunication
-> so to avoid that we use E2E in which testing is done from start to end in smooth flow
->also it replicates  real world scneraio its mimic is also done
-> it is better than unit testing and intergration testing
-> for this we use selenium
