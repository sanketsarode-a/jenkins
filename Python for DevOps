lets start with basic 
you know the logic mostly probably you will forget the syntax

so 
normal
for print we use 

print("sanket")

for a if else condtion
for a input we use

name = input("enter the name :")
by deafult it takes the string value 

if you want an int then typecast it
as 
num1 = int(input("enter the number")


if name=="sanket":
   print("corerct name")
else:
   print("incorerct")
