Azure Devops organization


ðŸš€ Azure repos (scm)    
   same as that of github


git vs TFVC
you can git clone that into vscode and add microsoft cred

it works as any change in vscode and commits will be reflected to azure repos (commits )

so how it wokrs local will be (vs code )
                remote will be ( azure repos)

various options such as fork and adding github connection

ðŸš€ Azure devops pipeline

   push to project
   clone the file into vscode
   add origin to vscode
   push the file to azure repos


ðŸš€ azure app services 
select web app --> no need to add nginx server or apache server just
                   add the application code
create web app

create pipeline in ADO


now to connect ado to azure portal we need service principal 

so that we can securly connect  --> known as service connection

ðŸš€ create a service connection 
    go to project setting --> service connection --> azure resource manager --> service principal (manual)
                             add all cred done

create a yaml file and done
