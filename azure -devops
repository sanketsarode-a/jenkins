Azure Devops organization

ðŸš€ Azure repos (scm)    
   same as that of github

git vs TFVC
you can git clone that into vscode and add microsoft cred

it works as any change in vscode and commits will be reflected to azure repos (commits )

so how it wokrs local will be (vs code )
                remote will be ( azure repos)

various options such as fork and adding github connection

ðŸš€ Azure devops pipeline

   push to project
   clone the file into vscode
   add origin to vscode
   push the file to azure repos


ðŸš€ azure app services 
select web app --> no need to add nginx server or apache server just
                   add the application code
create web app

create pipeline in ADO


now to connect ado to azure portal we need service principal 

so that we can securly connect  --> known as service connection

ðŸš€ create a service connection 
    go to project setting --> service connection --> azure resource manager --> service principal (manual)
                             add all cred done
    create a yaml file and done 




ðŸš€ðŸš€ðŸš€ðŸš€ðŸš€---> Deploy a application using azure web apps

1. import the repo
2. Build the pipeline add stages after build add artfact stage

            displayName: "Save Artifact"
            inputs:
              PathtoPublish: '$(Build.ArtifactStagingDirectory)'
              ArtifactName: 'drop'
              publishLocation: 'container'

                    appName: 'app-bdo-sut-apisvc-dev-0011'
                    package: '$(Pipeline.Workspace)/drop/*.zip'




ðŸš€ðŸš€ðŸš€ðŸš€ðŸš€---> Deploy a application using azure web apps with release pipeline

 1 : create a release pipeline 
           select template azzure web apps

2 : select the artifact enable the cd
          on default pipeline branch

3 : pre deployment condition
            
        trigger after release
        artifacts filter --> which branch
       
        add the task --> azure web service 
                         service connection

and that all
app type web app on Linux
the app service created on azure portal

run on agent azure pipeline
ubuntu latest


do you need deployment slot 
it is prechecking instead of deploying to prod

select resource group

and create a slot on azure portal 
under deployment 
create one slot

go back to pipeline 
there will the staging slot

and for the package of folder select from browse 
the name of the artifact


check upon the runtime stack 
needed on both portal as well as azure web app
node js 20x

do we want test on pre deploymne and then prod deployment 

blue green deployment

that means if the pre is successful and prod also
then swap them
