Azure Devops organization

🚀 Azure repos (scm)    
   same as that of github

git vs TFVC
you can git clone that into vscode and add microsoft cred

it works as any change in vscode and commits will be reflected to azure repos (commits )

so how it wokrs local will be (vs code )
                remote will be ( azure repos)

various options such as fork and adding github connection

🚀 Azure devops pipeline

   push to project
   clone the file into vscode
   add origin to vscode
   push the file to azure repos


🚀 azure app services 
select web app --> no need to add nginx server or apache server just
                   add the application code
create web app

create pipeline in ADO


now to connect ado to azure portal we need service principal 

so that we can securly connect  --> known as service connection

🚀 create a service connection 
    go to project setting --> service connection --> azure resource manager --> service principal (manual)
                             add all cred done
    create a yaml file and done 




🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀---> Deploy a application using azure web apps

1. import the repo
2. Build the pipeline add stages after build add artfact stage
   according to application
    task: PublishBuildArtifacts@1
            displayName: "Save Artifact"
            inputs:
              PathtoPublish: '$(Build.ArtifactStagingDirectory)'
              ArtifactName: 'drop'
              publishLocation: 'container'

3. now add the deployment stage 
   in that add everthing you need according to azure web apps
   please select the proper artifact destination

4.stage: DevelopmentStage
    displayName: "Deploying to Development Environment"
    jobs:
      - deployment: Dev
        pool:
          vmImage: ubuntu-latest
        environment: Dev
        strategy:
          runOnce:
            deploy:
              steps:
                - task: AzureWebApp@1
                  inputs:
                    azureSubscription: 'Devops-dev-svc'
                    appType: 'webAppLinux'
                    appName: 'app-bdo-sut-apisvc-dev-0011'
                    package: '$(Pipeline.Workspace)/drop/*.zip'




🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀---> Deploy a application using azure web apps with release pipeline

 1 : create a release pipeline 
           select template azzure web apps

2 : select the artifact enable the cd
          on default pipeline branch

3 : pre deployment condition
            
        trigger after release
        artifacts filter --> which branch
       
        add the task --> azure web service 
                         service connection

and that all
app type web app on Linux
the app service created on azure portal

run on agent azure pipeline
ubuntu latest


do you need deployment slot 
it is prechecking instead of deploying to prod

select resource group

and create a slot on azure portal 
under deployment 
create one slot

go back to pipeline 
there will the staging slot

and for the package of folder select from browse 
the name of the artifact


check upon the runtime stack 
needed on both portal as well as azure web app
node js 20x

do we want test on pre deploymne and then prod deployment 

blue green deployment

that means if the pre is successful and prod also
then swap them

🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀---> azure boards 
project management tools just like jira and notin

1. workitem --> unit of work that needs to be tracked, such as a bug, task, user story, feature, or epic

2. project --> basic -  epic , issue , task 
               agile -
               scrum -
               cmmi  -
the complexcity increases as goes down

3. open the board section it will open a kanban board
   which includes 3 section  { To do | Doing | Done }

4.Try open board and create a Epic workitem by name  {angular website}
  
iteration \ sprint --> a deafult sprint 1
stage can be changes --> to do | Doing | Done
also custom tags
also priority can be define
the start date and Target  date need to be mention as per the sprint 
and then mention someone in the decripition

and then save and close move it to doing
