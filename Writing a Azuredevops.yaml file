# Define specific branch to be trigger
trigger:
  branches:
    include:
      - main

# variable-- Define once and that can be used throughout the pipeline example we use define credentials
# and enviornment -- Agent to run the pipeline can be self hosted or azure by default
variables:
  buildconfiguration: 'release'
  vmImage: 'Ubuntu-latest'

# stages
stages:

  - stage: buildstage
    jobs:
      - job: build
        steps:
          - script: echo building

      - job: test
        steps:
          - task: NodeTool@0
            inputs:
              versionSpec: '14'
          - script: npm run build
          - script: echo "testing"

  - stage: deploystage
    jobs:
      - job: deploy
        steps:
          - script: echo "deploying"

🔍 Simplified Overview
Trigger: Starts the pipeline when code is pushed to the main branch.

Variables: Reusable values like environment settings (vmImage, buildconfiguration).

Stages: Main parts of the pipeline (e.g., buildstage, deploystage).

Jobs: Each stage has one or more jobs (e.g., build, test, deploy).

Steps: Inside each job — what you want the job to actually do.

Tasks: Built-in functions (e.g., set up Node.js).
