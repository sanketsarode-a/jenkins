# and enviornment -- Agent to run the pipeline can be self hosted or azure by default

variables:
      buildconfiguration : 'release'
      vmImage : 'Ubuntu-latest'

#stages

stages:

   -stage : buildstage
     jobs:
        -job:build
            steps:
              -script : echo building
   -stage : deploystage
     jobs:
         -job:deploy
             steps:
